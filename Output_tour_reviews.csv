2022-12-06,5,phenobenal treatment!
2022-12-06,2,"We took the Paris night bike tour hoping to get a good overview of basic sites and more importantly get a feel for biking around the city. This was such a disappointing experience. I am honestly surprised by the 5 star reviews. My husband and I have taken bike tours in other cities before and found them to be a great experience. From the moment we showed up at the green bikes meet up spot, things seemed really disorganized and chaotic. We were rushed to get bikes and bright yellow safety vests (which I am not mocking, it was a good idea to be very visible given the terrible instructions we were given at very busy traffic intersections during rush hour) and given very limited instructions. Our tour guide was a very sweet and personable (college-age I'm guessing?) woman that I believe was in over her head. She made it clear that the locals do not like the tour company and will give us a hard time wherever we go. That being said, we were instructed to push our way through intersections, block crosswalks, cut cars and pedestrians off and generally be a nuisance. Methinks not indeed! No wonder the locals don't like the tour company! The group was way too large to navigate the route that was chosen for us. A tour like this should have ten people tops and ours had 20-22 people in it. We were mortified at every turn. To make things worse, our guide thought it necessary (and funny?) to deliver her limited tour information in a really bad French accent. If I was a local (or another tourist) walking by, I'd be a little peeved. We come to cities to learn about the culture and the sights and respect the environment in which we are inserting ourselves - not mock it and be a nuisance! The tour was so bad, we tried to skip the boat portion at the end, but couldn't because we had to return the bikes to the shop with everyone else. We drank our free wine and looked longingly at the people sitting on the river's edge drinking and eating and having what had to be a better time than us. Maybe it was us, maybe it was an off day, who knows. Perhaps Paris is not that bike friendly of a city. Either way, we did not enjoy the night bike tour."
2022-12-06,4,"Great service, very friendly people. Our tour guide Peter was excellent and very upbeat even though it rained the whole way. Would definitely go again!"
2022-12-06,5,"amazing tour, we felt safe and an illuminated paris is completely enchanting. The tours were informative and our guide, Michelle was funny and warm"
2022-11-06,4,"Tour was informative, fun and generally a great way to learn a bit about Paris. The only issue was timing as we waited 20 minutes to get a bike. The biking isn't bad at all, but some of the spots were a bit dodgy with traffic as they drive dangerously in Paris and the bike paths are non-existant in some places"
2022-11-06,1,"Do not buy tickets through this company. Booked tickets for Louvre, showed up on time with confirmation and was told by a completely incompetent person checking people in that 'sorry, I don't have you on my list so you aren't on the tour.' Well, when I have all the confirmation emails, proof of payment, etc.. that answer is simply not acceptable. When speaking to the manager I was also told, 'we understand you paid and have a confirmation email, but you aren't going on the tour.' After refusing to take this as an answer, access was finally given. The girl even made a comment about how the worst part of her job is telling people who show up with confirmations that they don't have them on the list. So this happens on a regular basis?! If you want security when booking tours on your Paris holiday, do not book this company. Complete frauds."
2022-11-06,1,"DO NOT use this company!!! They are crooks. Booked the Night tour, they left without my family. Would not refund my money. HORRIBLE SERVICE. Save yourself the trouble!"
2022-10-06,3,"Great tour and guide but slightly marred by the fact the 4 hr bike tour was in fact a 3 hour tour plus an hour in the tour guides ""favourite"" cafe. I'll decide where I'll have lunch and it won't be a place that charges 5 euros for a 330mL can of fanta. That cafe owner must be very happy that green bikess delivers at least 4 groups of 16 tired and thirsty tourists to him everyday."
2022-10-06,5,"Great way to see Paris in a few hours! Our guide Tarik was amazing: fun, detailed and ensured everyone was safe! I would 100% recommend this! We’ve got so much ground covered, a great intro to the city!"
2022-10-06,5,"This was my second green bikes Bike Tour and it didn’t disappoint. Our guide was Annie from Ireland and she was friendly, easygoing and knowledgable. Paris was more hair raising than Berlin (my first green bikes experience) as it’s a much busier city packed with tourists so you need to concentrate to avoid any mishaps! We did the night hour tour which included a 45 mins stop for lunch at a restaurant. This is a great way to see a city and it beats the traditional bus tours hands down. If you’ve not done it before, give it a go! You won’t be disappointed:-)"
2022-10-06,1,A tour just cut in front of us at a very tight junction near Rue de Rivoli of the cyclists nearly ran me off the road desperate to keep up with the tour guide who had gone ahead. Didn't look safe or fun and made my personal cycle rather difficult!
2022-10-06,1,"A scam, they sell you a ticket that is not valid for access to the top of the Eiffel Tower and on top of that you have to wait 1 hour and a half and pay 4 times more, you only save the queue for the tickets, very bad organisation of the climb to the Eiffel Tower."
2022-10-06,1,"I would give this company zero if I could since they ruined my boat trip on the seine, Anyone reading this and planning a trip to take the fly boat should read this. I finally had the means to take my family on a European vacation, one of the biggest highlights was going to the top of the Eiffel Tower summit and river cruise. Unfortunately green bikes tours was the only tickets I could find you can get tickets straight from the fly boat web site for half the price, anyways do your homework. We had a few days before our tour date so I emailed them and asked about parking since I was driving a rental car. Since they already had my money the had no reason to help me out and give me any information about the parking situation. The day we arrived to go on the tour we arrived about 20 min early due to traffic. I drove around and around looking for a spot with no luck. We pulled up so my wife and twin 10 year old girls could get out and see if we could get some assistance from the people at green bikes Tours. The guy just pointed his finger and said go down the stree and there will be parking. I drove and drove with no luck. Finally I went back and had to tell my family to go without me so I wouldn't hold up the tour. (What a total let down) so while my wife was on the tour the tour guide told her she wasn't really sure if there was parking but heard that there was. What a joke!!! Sendng me somewhere they didn't even know if there was parking! I then after a day of disappointment emailed green bikes Tours and let them know how I felt and the situation. All they had to say is it was my fault and that I should have known the parking situation. WTH!! I'm from the states and I emailed the people who run a second rate tour company to get the info without any luck. F*$Kers. Anyways I know people read these so if anyone wants to help me make a statement and avoid this company and spread the word with your friends it would be much appreciated. If you are looking for a bike tour use this comany they were half the price of green bikes Bike About Tours, they were great and cost about $25 per person for 3 hour bike tour. If you made it through this thanks for letting me vent. P.S I never did get to see the city from the river seeing it was our last day in Paris. What a bummer"
2022-10-06,5,"My family and I did a tour with Helen two years ago. It was by far the funniest, most informative, and best bike tour we have been on!"
2022-09-06,5,"This was a great experience. The tour was very educational and fun. Emily is a great tour guide and made us feel very confortable. If I could give this a 10 star rating, I would with no hesitation."
2022-09-06,1,Just been hit by one of your bikes whilst walking along the Place du Panthéon. Not even an Apology! Almost ripped my Rucksack of my Shoulder and the Edge of the Handlebar hit me in the Rib Cage. You are an arrogant ignorant company and should not need conducting cycling tours in Historical Areas. The only reason you have 1 Star is because it wouldn't let me post with no star's!
2022-09-06,5,"Great tour! Interesting stories about the history of Paris and much more than that. A lot of good tips on what to visit in Paris. Very positive and active! In particular, thank you to our amazing guide - Ben."
2022-09-06,5,"A great way to see a lot of Paris in a day, Fran was a great, very knowledgeable and enthusiastic guide who made our experience that much better. Will definitely choose bike tours over walking in the future."
2022-09-06,5,My girlfriend and I ABSOLUTELY loved the tour. Our tour guide Ben was the greatest. Down to earth guy and knew Paris very well! The night tour was very fun. I would recommend it to anyone. It's a great way to start your French holiday!
2022-08-06,4,"Wonderful bike tour this morning. Everyone who works here is extremely kind, informative and loves sharing their city."
2022-08-06,5,This is a must do thing to do in Paris. You will see all the sights and sounds of Paris is a fun and efficient way. Nolan was a amazing guide !! Highly recommend!
2022-08-06,2,"The delivery was completely disorganised, a disgrace that a tour company delivered the tickets on the pavement of their shop. It took half an hour for a single person to make more deliveries, going through each voucher and making a mess. The boat trip is a waste for what it's worth and the Eiffel Tower is impressive."
2022-08-06,3,"They offer guided tours of Paris by bike. It was informative, but the waits in the office were long"
2022-08-06,4,"Nolan was our tour guide, and it was so enjoyable. A wonderful way to experience Paris, and it's good value for money too"
2022-07-06,1,"Our guide, Andrew, was not even French with very little knowledge. Just go alone and save the money"
2022-07-06,5,Experience an organised city tour of Paris' most important parks and squares. The tour is led by a guide who informs you of the main facts about the various monuments.
2022-06-25,1,"Another bike tour, selling tickets at highly inflated prices. Greedy"
2022-06-25,1,"This tour would be fun if you didn't have the majority of the drivers in paris trying to hit you. We paid a lot of money for that privilege 😠. What's more, the company didn't want to give us a refund when we told them! "
2022-06-25,4,"Very Informative tour! We went on the day tour and our guide (Peter) was very knowledgeable about the city, even the questions that weren't about the places we stopped! The only reason that I haven't given 5 stars is that we had to wait a while to go up the Eiffel Tower. The fast passes were a bit more like slow passes, but we enjoyed a beautiful sunny afternoon from the top! "
2022-06-25,5,Impeccable! 
2022-06-25,1,"Really disappointed with Green Bike tours. We arrived 5 minutes late and they told us that there was no room in the next tours, but that we could book a tour for the next day. Obviously when you are on holiday, you book other events, so they essentially made us choose between missing Versailles the next day, or going to the eiffel tower. Those were both THE things we wanted to do. What's more, they refused a refund when we asked for one. Avoid at all costs"
2022-06-25,4,"We didn't know what to expect, as the weather forcast was for rain, but on the day, there was nothing but blue skies, which really made the tour of gardens in Versailles that much more special! Our guide Michelle knew everything there was to know about the palace and its gardens. Very impressed. It just seemed like there wasn't so much bike-riding in the end, but i almost didn't notice!"
2022-06-25,3,"The night tour was really cool, but i think it was abit dangerous to ride through a busy city at night. The guides were good, but i didn't feel comfortable at some points as there was a few times we had to cross a busy road"
2022-06-25,3,"The guide was informative, but we had already seen the majority of the visits beforehand, so we wish there was more information about the stops. Good, though! "
2022-06-25,5,"the weather was amazeballs, which made the hole tour well good! My boyfriend proposed to me during the trip and i said yes. I'll never forget this! "
2022-06-25,2,"Long waits in the office, but once we got going it seemed like fun until it began to rain. Our tour guide, Nicola, clearly didn't want to be there when it started, and didn't like it when i asked her questions "
2022-06-25,4,"This is my 2nd Green Bikes Tour 🚲 and i have to say that it was better than the one i did in Barcelona. Our guide was very knowledgeable and informative. We even had a chance to go up the eiffel tower, but chose not too, as i'm afrait of heights"
2022-06-25,3,"When we arrived at the Office, there were some long waits, but i can understand from the volume of people they have. The tour was good, nothing special, but fun. I prefer to do the free walking tours as you can learn more about certain neighbourhoods and their creepy stories 👹"
2022-06-25,2,
2022-06-25,5,
2022-06-24,4,"The Versailles tour was breathtaking and very informative. I wish there had been less people at the palace, as the fast passes we bought with the company didn't make much of a difference. "
2022-06-24,4,"My family and i had a really fun experience with Tarik, he explained everything about Versailles in such an intriguing way. The palace was busier than a metro at rush hour, but we didn't get lost and the day was great."
2022-06-24,4,"In the hands of our guide, Helen, we really felt that safety was not a problem, she professionally guided us through the busiest parts of paris with no problems. It was very informative, but i did feel the break was a bit long."
2022-06-23,2,
2022-06-23,2,"Disappointed to be honest, after our Green Bike's Tour in Berlin , we were expecting a similar setup, but the majority of Paris' streets were uncyclable. The guide knew a lot, but obviously didn't like the city either. How can you enjoy your holiday if even the tour guide isn't interested?"
2022-06-23,4,"Yes, the wait was long at the office, but the guides managed to keep us entertained while the groups ahead of us were getting ready. Once we were on our bikes, we were off, and i have to say, it was splendid! My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed Paris in the morning. The queues weren't too long to get up the eiffel tower, the tour guide was very informative and made us laugh all of the time. Apart from the wait, it was perfect! "
2022-06-22,1,"The company doesn't care about the safety of its clients. Sure, we had helmets, but the streets were so busy and someone in our group was almost hit by a car…the guide didn't seem to care!"
2022-06-22,4,"So much fun!! It was my first, but definitely not my last green bike tour. "
2022-06-22,4,"All of the comments about the tours being dangerous are ridiculous! Our guide, Laura, made sure we were safe at all times and expertly navigated through the traffic. They do drive aggressively in the city, but we never felt unsafe! "
2022-06-22,5,We were amazed that our guide maintained such a high level of quality when the weather was so bad. Nolan was funny and actually helped make the rain seem more enjoyable! 100% will do it again (maybe when the weather is better 😉) 
2022-06-22,1,"The bikes in such big groups are dangerous in the streets of Paris. I would never take a tour on a bike like that; paris is to be enjoyed by walking along the Seine, not on one of those monstrosities"
2022-06-22,2,"The tour was great fun to begin with, but halfway through i began to fear for my safety, as the saddle on my bike started to come loose and it's not fun trying to navigate around paris with bike problems. Luckily after 10 minutes i managed to catch the guide's attention and he had some tools to fix it. Good tour, but i was spending the rest of it worried that my bike was going to fall apart"
2022-06-22,1,"Incredible that a company like this could expect a group of 18 people to ride around a busy city where the traffic doesn't even care that you are there. We were almost hit by a car and the only thing the guide could say was that the people of Paris didn't like the bike tours, so it was to be expected! I definitely won't book a bike tour again, walking tours are much safer!"
2022-06-22,5,
2022-06-22,5,Fantastic views of paris from the eiffel tower! The guide was very knowledgable and it was such a pleasure to see the city while cycling around. 100% would do it again with green bike tours! 
2022-06-22,4,
2022-06-21,3,Good
2022-06-21,1,"Uncomfortable facilities. You have to be there at the agreed time, as it is the guide who does the work, they don't do anything. They accompany you, you avoid the queues and little else. It is an entrance without queues like any other."
2022-06-21,5,"If you looking for a hip, cool thing to go in Paris, look no further than green bikes tours. Nolan our guide was informative and very intriguing. So much so my friend who had never toured by bike was so enthralled by both the bike and the guide. :) If you are looking for a cool experience take a ride."
2022-06-20,4,
2022-06-20,5,Fabulous
2022-06-20,5,"Great way to see Paris! Guide was amazing, detailed and ensured everyone was safe! 10/10 would recommend! "
2022-06-20,4,Very good😉
2022-06-19,5,"This tour was excellent! It was our favorite part of our trip so far, we saw several places we wouldn’t have appreciated without Annie’s insights and we loved hearing about the city from her perspective."
2022-06-19,5,Peter was a great guide.
2022-06-19,5,"Emily was our guide during our bike tour of Paris. She was very knowledgeable about the history of the city and provided a great depth of knowledge about the city. I would not hesitate to take another tour with this company, they were great to work with and the process of booking the tour couldn’t be easier. "
2022-06-19,5,
2022-06-18,3,"Done two other green bikes tours, this one ranks 3 . Good guide , actual tour a bit ho hum"
2022-06-18,5,"Our second time to Paris and second bike tour. We were pleased to learn new things from our tour guide Nolan, who added his own anecdotes and memories to the experience. It was very friendly, a small group of just 4 people. Nolan was very knowledgeable and willing to explain more about history and share stories at each stop and at each request. He was very informative and pointed out good spots to stop for a bite to eat. Would definitely recommend for a first time visit to Paris."
2022-06-18,5,The best tours in Paris. Knowledgeable and friendly guides!
2022-06-17,5,"Tarik is really nice and he helped me a lot with good, instructive intentions. When he goes to Seville, i will definitely rent a bike from him!"
2022-06-17,3,An agency that handles a large volume of people. Good service if the facilities are not comfortable.
2022-06-17,4,
2022-06-17,3,
2022-06-17,2,"our guide was not particularly informative. He shared the Wikipedia info but I expect more, much more. I can Google the places, but what I'm curious about is the local knowledge that an effective guide should offer. I overheard another guide sharing some insight and wished I had signed up for that tour! Overall, a disappointment."
2022-06-17,5,Amazing tour
2022-06-16,4,Good
2022-06-16,5,Fantastic tour with Tim yesterday. So much knowledge to share. Highly recommend!
2022-06-16,5,"Great way to learn about Paris. Our guide Helen was funny and informative. The ride was comfortable - not too long. The bike was well-maintained, although I found the steering to be too sensitive. But then, that's probably down to personal preference. Overall, a good experience."
2022-06-15,4,"A tourist agency in Paris, we couldn't get tickets to go up the tower with the tower's website, so we did it through the agency, it's a bit more expensive, but if you insist on going up and left it until the last minute... It's the best option. "
2022-06-15,4,"The tour was really interesting, at first i was worried that riding through paris at night would be a bit dangerous, but the guide kept safety a priority."
2022-06-15,5,"Amazing! We had great time! We were incredibly lucky that we booked our tour on a day that was not too busy! Our guide Henry was amazing, friendly, knowledge le and very good. He took us pretty much everywhere we wanted and gave us some very good information. I look forward to do the tour again on my next visit to Paris!"
2022-06-14,5,green bikes tours are always a fantastic way to explore the city. This is the 3rd GBT tour and lives up to all expectations and more. The information provided went into just the right detail and the route had been well planned. Our Guide Tarik couldn’t have been more helpful. The guys in the office on our return were also great and provided further information for the rest of our stay. 5* way to explore Paris!
2022-06-14,5,"The tour was super interesting, you learnt a lot about history, but also discussed current issues/things. Lucilla, our guide, did a great job and I recommend it to everyone. She got an excellent overview of the city and had all the information about the city."
2022-06-13,5,"The best I have ever seen in my life, the employees are real vitality, you go there half convinced and you do any of their Tours and they convince you completely. The best money invested in my life. The day and night tours with the bike are spectacular. "
2022-06-13,5,"Our night bike tour was one of the highlights of the trip, and it was a unique and fun experience. Eric was our tour guide, and he was knowledgeable but not stuffy. He was not only able to give us a background on the landmarks and monuments that were an official part of the tour, he was also able to tell us about other places that we passed by, no matter what was asked of him. To top off the night, we took a Seine cruise, and even though it's a very touristy thing to do, it felt absolutely magical with all of Paris lit up. Had I known the tour would be so amazing, I would have signed up for at least one more - don't hesitate to book with green bikes!"
2022-06-13,5," Absolutely had the best time. Our guide Anny was fantastic,funny and very informative. BI highly recommend this tour and thankyou to this company for a great day. We will also do this in the other cities we visit in europe"
2022-06-13,1,Rubbish! 
2022-06-13,2,"Ok so this is a really hard one for me. Let me start with the things I really didn't like; First and this was a biggy for me, I couldn't book any of this through an independent travel agent. These tours are premium priced and I can't believe that as a service they could not be booked in conjunction with my other tours & plans. So that added to the stress. I found some of the tour dates to be VERY restrictive too. More on this later. One of the tours had instructions that indicated I was in the correct place, however it was incredibly hard to find Ok so for the good; The guides generally were great. Very knowledgable & genuine in their understanding of the city. Generally the tours are fairly in depth. You can also book serval different tours and always learn new things in new areas. I ended up getting to Paris late and couldn't make my first evening ride. They kindly offered to exchange the booking for another tour. However I believe they could still be more flexible on the cancelation policy. Again it was a difficult choice to give it this mark, it's actually on the higher side of two stars, but it wasn't up to my expectations. This being said, the staff were great"

2022-06-06,5,Nice Place

2022-06-06,5,"Another great experience with green bikes Tours in Paris, France. Did the day and night rides. Easy, casual way to see the city. Our guides were unbelievable with their knowledge and history of the city. Absolutely fabulous! Highly recommend green bikes Tours!"
2022-06-06,5,What a great way to see Paris. Marco was a great guide and all the staff were amazing . I would highly recommend to anyone .
2022-06-06,5,"We highly recommend the Paris Night Tour - it was easily one of the best tours of our lives! We were very fortunate to have Emily to explore Paris and it was such a fun night. We began at sunset, and felt very safe, confident, and comfortable. The sites were so beautiful at night and Emily had such great knowledge and stories to share with us. She had a really unique way of explaining Parisian history that taught me more than I had learned on any other tour.  Emily brought this tour to the next level with his personality and service, and it was so exceptional, personal, and memorable! Thank you Emily!!!"
2022-05-31,3,"A place to rent bikes to learn about Paris, you can go in large or small groups with a guide who will take you on a tour of the most emblematic sights. It's a little bit difficult to find; look hard enough and you will find it. Good luck!"
2022-05-31,5,Had a tour with Ben today. I cannot recommend this enough. Fantastic guide with so much knowledge and a real passion for his work.
2022-05-31,5,"Our third green bikes Tour didn’t disappoint! We reckon these tours are the best way to introduce a new city for the first time. Our guide Peter took us around Paris at a decent pace, with some great insights into the historical landscape. Would definitely recommend. "
2022-05-31,4,
2022-05-31,5,"From the moment I stepped into the office I was greeted by the friendly and helpful staff. My tour group was led by Laura, who was fun, informative and lovely! When we arrived back at the office they happily volunteered more advice on places to eat and visit. I couldn’t recommend this company anymore. Enjoy!!"
2022-05-31,5,"This was such a great way to see the city. If you are considering it, don’t hesitate. Shaun was super kind and informative. Being on bikes was great and allowed us to cover more ground and beat the heat."
2022-05-31,4,"Friendly, knowledable staff, intersting route, the bikes were clean and well maintained"
2022-05-30,5,Fantastic experience. Now I want to go to all of the locations. I think this is the best way to see the city. Highly recommended!
2022-05-30,5,"We visited Paris and this was our family's #1 favorite activity! We saw ALL the top attractions, got exercise, and familiarized ourselves with the lay of the land during the tour. Emily was a fantastic tour guide. She delivered the history and facts in a fun and interesting way. It was nice to meet folks from other cities and we truly had a fantastic time. Can't wait to book a green bikes London tour next! "
2022-05-30,4,"My second green bikes experience and a fun time. Our guide, Samantha, was excellent and organized. The bike ride portion of the tour was the best experience and we got to see many areas one would not normally see on a walking tour. Thanks to green bikes for accomodating our group of 11 on same tour. After we turned the bikes in and our guide took us to the Eiffel Tower we ran into some unknown problem actually making entry and had to wait outside about 45 minutes to actually get inside. Not sure what the problem was but it detracted from an otherwise great tour."
2022-05-30,3,The view is breathtaking. However the company we went with charged us 100€ and we didn't even go up to the 3rd floor. Too many security checks. From Spain we were told that the tickets were full by the agencies.
2022-05-30,1,"Beware of this company! They will never give your money back even if they leave you at the beginning of the tour and do not answer the phone when you try to get ahold of them. For our 15th anniversary and my wife’s birthday, we planned a night tour of Paris with this company. We emailed several times and spoke the night before the tour and the morning of the tour - they knew we were coming. Traffic was especially bad that morning and our taxi got us to the meeting spot 3 minutes late. I spoke with a company representative on the way to the meeting spot (told her we were going on the tour and meeting the group in Paris) and told them we would be a few minutes late due to traffic. When we arrived, we looked and looked but couldn’t find the tour group. I called and waited for several minutes twice. No answer or reply. The tour group ditched us and was not answering the phone! Not a great spot to be in when you are in a foreign country. I sent an email to the company hoping to get in touch. Afterwards my phone ran out of batteries. Given the situation we made alternate plans - rather than sit around all day waiting for the company to get back in touch with us. When I was able to charge my phone, we got back in touch. I wanted a refund!!! They refused and continue to refuse to issue the refund. They only offered to go at 3 pm on a tour the next day- but we had already made alternate plans ... plus who in their would go on a tour after this experience."
2022-05-30,1,Very expensive and they only take you to the door - don't do it! It's better to buy tickets on the spot
2022-05-30,1,"The famous Eiffel Tower queue cutter ticket is a scam!!! It's exactly the same as booking on the Eiffel Tower website! First on the agency's website they write that it's a promo at 19 euros per ticket then when you pay it goes up to 39 euros per ticket! They ask you to arrive at the travel agency 15 min before the meeting time to finally wait and arrive 45 min later at the Eiffel Tower! And then you think you're going to overtake everyone else with your ""cut line"" ticket (which you paid 39 euros instead of 11 euros on the Eiffel Tower website!) and well NO! You queue like everyone else!"
2022-05-29,3,"Tour was going pretty good, until we were taken to a terrible restaurant for ‘food’. When will tour operators get it! The absolute lack of respect for the customer that is demonstrated when the guide takes you to eat somewhere that doesn’t reflect the local cuisine or culture. This aspect really let the whole tour experience down. We were taken to a restaurant that served nachos with plastic cheese! Disgusting! "
2022-05-29,4,"Had a great experience touring Paris at night. Our tour guide was Annie, and she was fantastic. Would repeat again and recommend to others."

2022-05-29,5,Incredible
2022-05-29,2,"The tour was quite cool, but the group was too numrous, 15 people with children. We had to wait for them to catch up, incapable of crossing the streets in rush hour, a real shame. We shouldn't have been any more than ten people. A shame"
2022-05-28,4,good people to tour in France paris
2022-05-28,4,It was a cold day but we've done 3 bike tours and Paris was by far the best compared to Barcelona and Madrid. Ben was fun and super informative. I felt I had a good grasp of the cities history after all was said and done.
2022-05-28,1,They confirmed our tour 2 days before and not come to the location they cannot be trusted
2022-05-28,5,Excellent tour guides.
2022-05-28,5,We had an amazing experience biking through Paris with green bikes Tours. Our tour guide Ben was extremely knowledgeable and offered thoughtful and valuable insights about the history of Paris and France. It was an excellent experience that I highly recommend for any traveler to Paris.
2022-05-28,1,"The only experience I had was arriving to the place only to be disappointed, my wife had spoken to a gentleman over the phone one day ahead of appointment about confirming our booking. He asked us if we'd like the option to take the bike and food tour at 10am or 4pm? We confirmed for 4pm and we trusted that it would be entered into their system but on arrival the woman at the shop told us nothing was confirmed, absolutely no sympathy, there was no refund nor no compensation alternatives for the day."
2022-05-28,5,Had a wonderful time great tour guide
2022-05-28,5,Fantastic tour. Helen gave us insights into Paris that only come with passion. The family loved it. Second green bikes tour after Berlin. No better way to see a city. Would recommend it to everyone 😁😁😁…
2022-05-28,5,Excelente
2022-05-27,4,"Great bike tour of Paris. Not strenuous at all. Lots of stops for pictures and history, background information and local color. Luke, our guide, was fun, informative, knowledge and humorous. He was also great at keeping track of the whole group (which was pretty large at 18 people!) and keeping everyone safe and together (dominate!). It was great biking by all the cars that were stuck in traffic. Definitely recommended way to see Paris."
2022-05-27,4,The tour was great. Good way to see Paris and learn about some of it history while exercising.
2022-05-26,5,"We booked the night tour and had an amazing time! Our guide, Ben, was very knowledgeable, friendly, and enthusiastic. He made sure that we all had a great time. He also took lots of pictures for us! Would 100% recommend that you book a tour with these guys"
2022-05-26,2,Our guide (David) was not very good at sticking with our tour subject.
2022-05-26,3,"200metres from the Eiffel Tower It's always open, they do groups and to go up the tower, passing through the queues at the controls and everything."
2022-05-26,3,Bit expensive but enjoyable ride
2022-05-26,4,"Ask for Laura, she was very knowledgeable, funny and overall did a great job."
2022-05-25,5,Tim was an excellent tour guide! The bike tour was so much fun and very informational. I would recommend this tour to everyone.…
2022-05-25,1,
2022-05-25,3,Meh but it's ok
2022-05-25,4,"A very nice and friendly welcome, a great visit of Paris by bike. Great when the weather is nice."
2022-05-24,5,"Samantha, our English speaking tour guide, was just lovely lovely lovely devine. She showed us some glorious spots near the Eiffel Tower that helped us understand why this city is truly magnificent."
2022-05-24,3,"When I arrived in Paris, I took part in the Night tour. The guide Emily was very good, knowledgeable and had a good dinner. It is easy to travel by bicycle in Rome, you can go to more places and take more pictures."
2022-05-23,4,"Loved our green bikes tours! We did the Night tour. Only thing keeping this from a five star review is that it felt like our group was a tad large for riding around Paris as a unit. Our tour also had kids on it, (6-10 years old) which was FINE, but as an adult it gets old listening to the interruptions of kids. Would rather them do ""family rides"" for kids. Other than that, the guides are excellent and the ride is easy!"
2022-05-23,4,
2022-05-23,3,"Bikes a nice way to complement a walking tour but our guide was not very knowledgeable and we covered a lot of areas with no commentary. I would have preferred a shorter tour with a much quicker ""snack"" spot versus a sit down meal so early into the evening. Paled in comparison to bike tours in Barcelona and Luxembourg. "
2022-05-23,5,"Great time, good jokes and Tim was great too"
2022-05-06,1,We paid for a guided tour. It was 6 times the normal price so we expected a well guided tour. When we arrived at the tower our guide left us which meant that we ourselves should find the right line ( Hint: It's NOT easy when you doesn't speak a word french) As said the guide left our group which meant we didn't got a guided tour as we paid for. NOT recommended!! They literally took 250$ for entrance without our guide even guiding us!
2022-05-06,3,"Wow, it's great to admire this wonderful city of Paris in this way. I booked this tour simply and rudely and enjoyed it. Not only the bike tour experience, but also our guide, Sally was amazing! Take us to appreciate the style of this city!"
2022-04-06,5,"My wife and I took the night tour with Nick, an exceptional guide, very knowledgeable and entertaining.  Cannot recommend enough, super fun all day trip. Be sure to bring some cash to tip your guide, thanks Peter, very much enjoyed the tour! "
2022-03-06,5,We had an amazing experience
2022-02-06,4,"Wonderful tour company in Paris offering english language visits with many skip-the-line options to seeing some of the best sights in Paris, which if you're here on a short visit, can be incredibly helpful. Also, if you get a chance to ride a bike around Paris, I think you definitely should. Very nice staff, easy to follow and the rides aren't difficult"
2022-02-06,5,Very friendly and knowledgeable tour guide. Added a whole geographical and historical dimension to the experience of visiting Paris and its monuments!

2022-02-06,5,
2022-01-06,5,"This should be a 'MUST DO' when visiting Paris! green bikes was very organized, Groups are kept to a max of 12 persons so it's feels like a well managed, safe, city bike tour! Emily our guide was awesome! Reasonably priced also!"
2022-01-06,5,Very nice guides and the information given was excellent
2022-01-06,4,"tour was fantastic - made more so by our guide Emily- she was a fantastic bundle of energy, passion and knowledge and steered the group well accross major roads and intersections"

2022-01-06,4,Great tour with a very knowledgeable guide.
